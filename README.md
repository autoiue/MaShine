# HOW TO USE 
Download the [latest build](https://github.com/pr0csynth/MaShine/blob/master/dist/mashine.jar?raw=true). You may want to install [OLA](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/) to output real DMX, but you can still use MaShine without it.

Midi devices only tested on Linux. Otherwise it should be crossplateform (OLA is only available on Linux and OSX).

TODO : user manual.

# HOW TO BUILD

Require Java 8 and ant to build. Run `ant` in the root folder to build and run.

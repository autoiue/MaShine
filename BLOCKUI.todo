# What to do to get block ui ?

- make all relevant classes inherits from Block
- write Grid to render Blocks and expose to the user the mechanics of linking
- write Grid to render/recalc Paths when needed (path.isInRegion(x, y, w, h))
- write Engine to make blocks work together (tick ?)
- write a new class Panel to render existing UiBoxes as side bar
